Glitching NPC's: Looming Darkness

## About
Looming Darkness is a 2D, top-down retro-style game that takes place in a pitch black creepy cave with a dark fantasy setting. Your goal as the player is to survive and get out of the labyrinth. This job won't be easy though, as you only have a limited light source and your field of vision is restrained. In Looming Darkness as the title indicates, you're surrounded by darkness that's closing in on you as you play.

## About us
