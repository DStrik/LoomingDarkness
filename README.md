Glitching NPC's: Looming Darkness


Interactable objects:
to make object interactable give it the interactableobject script and the tag interObj (this is for the player interaction script to distinguish interactive object collision from others (like walls)).
Set storage variable to true if it should be storable in inventory.

Main Camera:
New main camera under prefabs, delete your old main camera and put the new one in. Then move the character to the Character object in the main camera. This will now work with the lighting effects!
